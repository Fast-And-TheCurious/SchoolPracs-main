<!-- Login Form (login.html):

The HTML form (<form>) is defined with a POST method and an action attribute pointing to /login. This means that when a user submits this form, it will send a POST request to the /login endpoint on your server.

Inside the form, there are input fields for the user to enter their email/username and password.

When the user clicks the "Login" button, it triggers the form submission. The action attribute directs the browser to send a POST request to your server at /login.

Signup Form (signUp.html):

Similar to the login form, the signup form is defined with a POST method and an action attribute pointing to /register. When a user submits this form, it sends a POST request to the /register endpoint on your server.

The form includes input fields for the user to enter their desired username, email, and password.

When the user clicks the "Sign Up" button, it triggers the form submission, and the action attribute directs the browser to send a POST request to your server at /register.

Server-Side Logic (server.js):

In your Node.js server code (server.js), you would need to implement the logic to handle these endpoints (/login and /register).

For the /register endpoint:

The server should receive the user's registration data (username, email, password) in the POST request.
It should then validate the data (e.g., check if the email is unique).
Hash and salt the password for security.
Store the user's data in the database (in your "User" table) to create a new user account.
For the /login endpoint:

The server should receive the user's login data (email/username and password) in the POST request.
It should look up the user's information in the database based on the provided email/username.
Verify the password by comparing the entered password with the stored hashed password.
If the credentials match, create a session/token to authenticate the user and grant access to protected resources or redirect them to their dashboard. -->
